This survey was conducted to collect user’s feedback and satisfaction to our recommendation. This form includes 4 parts: basic information, individual recommendation satisfaction, group recommendation satisfaction, and overall satisfaction with the application.

We surveyed by sharing the Google Forms through social media platforms e.g. Facebook, etc. and direct message in person. This survey had 41 respondents.

Part 1: Basic Information

This part we didn’t require the answer from the respondents.

\caption{Satisfaction of Restaurant Recommendation for Individual}\label{fig:A2SatisfactionofRestaurantRecommendationforIndividual}
\end{figure}space{-24pt}

In this section, we created 5 questions to collect the satisfaction which are:

Suggested restaurant types match your interests

Suggested restaurant prices match your interests

Able to decide the restaurant more easily

The restaurant has accurate details

Fast recommendation system

These questions are collected in the pattern of score 1 to 5. As we can see from the figure, we found that the average score of all answers is around 4-5 scores which can conclude that most users are quite satisfied with this individual recommendation result.

Part 3: Group Recommendation Satisfaction

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=350pt]{./images/A2NumberofRespondentsthatusingGroupRecommendation.png}
\caption{Number of Respondents that using Group Recommendation}\label{fig:A2NumberofRespondentsthatusingGroupRecommendation}
\end{figure}space{-24pt}

There are only 34.1% from all respondents that use a group recommendation which is expected to be caused by the COVID-19 situation.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=350pt]{./images/A2SatisfactionofRestaurantRecommendationforGroup.png}
\caption{Satisfaction of Restaurant Recommendation for Group}\label{fig:A2SatisfactionofRestaurantRecommendationforGroup}

The questions are the same as Satisfaction of Restaurant Recommendation for Individual. we found that the average score of all answers is around 4-5 scores which is the same as individual. So, we can conclude that most users are quite satisfied with this group recommendation result too.

\end{figure}space{-24pt}



In summary, lots of feedback wants more pictures and details of each restaurant, less process before getting to the recommendation page and some suggestions of the user interface. Moreover, with some feedback we can bring the idea to our future works.
