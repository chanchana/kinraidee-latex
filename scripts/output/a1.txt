\caption{Top 3 Conditions to Find the Restaurant when Eating Alone}\label{fig:A1Top3ConditionstoFindtheRestaurantwhenEatingAlone}
\end{figure}

As you can see from Figure~\ref{fig:A1Top3ConditionstoFindtheRestaurantwhenEatingAlone}, the condition that concerns them the most when eating alone is the price followed by the quality of food then available for delivery. Moreover, they are still concerned about the distance between them and the restaurant too.

Forms response chart. Question title: โดยเฉลี่ยคุณใช้เวลาเลือกร้านอาหารนานเท่าไหร่. Number of responses: 148 responses.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=350pt]{./images/A1AverageTimetoSelecttheRestaurantAlone.png}
\caption{Average Time to Select the Restaurant Alone}\label{fig:A1AverageTimetoSelecttheRestaurantAlone}
\end{figure}

From Figure~\ref{fig:A1AverageTimetoSelecttheRestaurantAlone}, the most range of time that respondents spend to select the restaurant in an individual is 5 - 10 minutes with 40.5% followed by 10 - 30 minutes which 35.1% Furthermore, we notice that with 11.5% they said that depending on the period.

\end{figure}

We found that around 62.8% of respondents have a problem with restaurant selection which can prove our assumption that making the decision to go to the restaurant for each meal is still a problem nowadays.

Forms response chart. Question title: มื้อใดที่เกิดปัญหานี้มากที่สุด. Number of responses: 144 responses.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=350pt]{./images/A1WhichMealHasProblemtheMost.png}
\caption{Which Meal Has Problem the Most}\label{fig:A1WhichMealHasProblemtheMost}
\end{figure}

The meal that everyone has the most problem with is dinner time. In our opinion, we think that it is the first meal that everybody reunited again after work or study. So many people, many conditions, which leads to complex decision making.

Forms response chart. Question title: ระหว่างการสั่งแบบ delivery กับ ไปกินที่ร้าน แบบใดที่มีปัญหาในการเลือกร้านอาหารมากกว่ากัน. Number of responses: 148 responses.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=350pt]{./images/A1ProblemBetweenDine-inandDelivery.png}
\caption{Problem Between Dine-in and Delivery}\label{fig:A1ProblemBetweenDine-inandDelivery}
\end{figure}

In Figure~\ref{fig:A1RestaurantConsiderationSurveyinGoogleform}1, you can see that dine-in and delivery are almost half-and-half. For dine-in problems, they said that it is hard to find the restaurant and decisions cannot be made quickly but for delivery, they know which restaurant to eat due to the foods’ picture of each restaurant and dine-in needs to consider more conditions than delivery. For delivery problems, they said that it is hard to decide what to eat because there is an overwhelming amount of restaurants to choose from and the main condition needed to consider is the distance from the restaurant.

Part 3: Groups Eating Consideration

Forms response chart. Question title: โดยเฉลี่ยกลุ่มของคุณใช้เวลาเลือกร้านอาหารนานเท่าไหร่. Number of responses: 148 responses.

\end{figure}

We found that around 65.5% of respondents have a problem with restaurant selection in groups which compared to individual problems, has increased up to 2.7%. Thus, we can conclude that people faced more pain with group eating than individuals.

Next, we want to know which group usually faces the pain of this problem. Figure~\ref{fig:A1RestaurantConsiderationSurveyinGoogleform}5 reveals that a group of friends usually faced the pain with 75.3% and followed by family then, boyfriend/girlfriend.

\caption{Reason of Problem that Frequently Occurs when Eating in Group}\label{fig:A1ReasonofProblemthatFrequentlyOccurswhenEatinginGroup}
\end{figure}

In conclusion, the main issue of this problem is about the member of that group cannot decide what and where to eat. Finally, the decision cannot be made.

Forms response chart. Question title: คุณมีส่วนร่วมในการตัดสินใจเลือกร้านอาหารมากน้อยแค่ไหน. Number of responses: 97 responses.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering

\end{figure}

Most of the solution is voting and going to the restaurant that wins by majority vote and a few said that eating separately. However, this cannot serve all members' conditions, some of them complain and feel bad when their choices don't bring up to the group.

Part 4: Experience of using Recommendation Applications

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=350pt]{./images/A1PercentageofRespondentsthatUsingRecommendationApplications.png}
\caption{Percentage of Respondents that Using Recommendation Applications}\label{fig:A1PercentageofRespondentsthatUsingRecommendationApplications}
\end{figure}

Surprisingly found that most of the respondents never use the recommendation application with over 70%.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=350pt]{./images/A1RecommendationApplications.png}
\caption{Recommendation Applications}\label{fig:A1RecommendationApplications}
\end{figure}

There are a variety of ways for the recommendation system from excel to the randomization application. Moreover, they use a delivery application to choose their restaurant as a recommender.

\begin{figure}[H]\centering
\includegraphics[width=350pt]{./images/A1UsageProblemofExistingRecommendationApplication.png}
\caption{Usage Problem of Existing Recommendation Application}\label{fig:A1UsageProblemofExistingRecommendationApplication}
\end{figure}

Even there’s a lot of recommendations, it is still randomized, the menu is not updated, and most applications just recommend common food, not restaurants. Moreover, some of the applications are too complex to use.
