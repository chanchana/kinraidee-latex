We can divide our future works into 3 parts which are dataset, web application and recommendation improvement. In the dataset improvement, we could improve the restaurant image problem by using other external services or try to find alternative data sources that provide us more accurate information. In web application improvement, we plan to add a group chat feature to improve the discussion process in group recommendation. Lastly, in the recommendation improvement, we can try to tune the parameters and do more experiments of our genetic algorithm, so the performance and usersâ€™ satisfaction will be increased.

Moreover, in the web application improvement, we could integrate our existing application with LINE Mini App. Figure~\ref{fig:5LINEMiniAppIntegration} shows the 3 main benefits from this integration. The first one is, users can easily add the application to their LINE home screen without any installation. For the next one, users can invite friends via individual and group LINE chat. Lastly, users can easily see and join a group within LINE chat.
